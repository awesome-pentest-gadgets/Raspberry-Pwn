Important
----------------------------------------------
* Raspberry Pwn is built on DEBIAN - not RASPBIAN - and will not work on RASPBIAN images!! This install guide was tested with the "Soft-float Debian Wheezy" build and works as expected.

----------------------------------------------
What you will need
----------------------------------------------

1. A stock Raspberry Pi board (http://www.raspberrypi.org/)
2. The Debian (not Raspbian) Raspberry Pi distribution. The Debian build is regularly updated,
   so look at http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads for the latest download.
3. An SD card of at least 4GB in size
4. SSH/console access to the Raspberry Pi
5. Internet access from the Raspberry Pi
